						<article>
							The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.
							<br><br>
							<h3>History of IoT</h3>
							<br>
							Kevin Ashton, co-founder of the Auto-ID Center at MIT, first mentioned the internet of things in a presentation he made to Procter & Gamble (P&G) in 1999. Wanting to bring radio frequency ID (RFID) to the attention of P&G's senior management, Ashton called his presentation "Internet of Things" to incorporate the cool new trend of 1999: the internet. MIT professor Neil Gershenfeld's book, When Things Start to Think, also appearing in 1999, didn't use the exact term but provided a clear vision of where IoT was headed.
							<br><br>
							The first internet appliance, for example, was a Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon University in the early 1980s. Using the web, programmers could check the status of the machine and determine whether there would be a cold drink awaiting them, should they decide to make the trip to the machine.
							<br><br>
							IoT evolved from machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, i.e., machines connecting to each other via a network without human interaction. M2M refers to connecting a device to the cloud, managing it and collecting data.
							<br><br>
							Taking M2M to the next level, IoT is a sensor network of billions of smart devices that connect people, systems and other applications to collect and share data. As its foundation, M2M offers the connectivity that enables IoT.
							<br><br>
							<h3>How IoT works</h3>
							<br>
							An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded processors, sensors and communication hardware to collect, send and act on data they acquire from their environments. IoT devices share the sensor data they collect by connecting to an IoT gateway or other edge device where data is either sent to the cloud to be analyzed or analyzed locally. Sometimes, these devices communicate with other related devices and act on the information they get from one another. The devices do most of the work without human intervention, although people can interact with the devices -- for instance, to set them up, give them instructions or access the data.
							<br><br>
							The connectivity, networking and communication protocols used with these web-enabled devices largely depend on the specific IoT applications deployed.
							<br><br>
							<h3>Why IoT is important</h3>
							<br>
							The internet of things helps people live and work smarter as well as gain complete control over their lives. In addition to offering smart devices to automate homes, IoT is essential to business. IoT provides businesses with a real-time look into how their companies’ systems really work, delivering insights into everything from the performance of machines to supply chain and logistics operations.
							<br><br>
							IoT enables companies to automate processes and reduce labor costs. It also cuts down on waste and improves service delivery, making it less expensive to manufacture and deliver goods as well as offering transparency into customer transactions.
							<br><br>
							IoT touches every industry, including healthcare, finance, retail and manufacturing. Smart cities help citizens reduce waste and energy consumption and connected sensors are even used in farming to help monitor crop and cattle yields and predict growth patterns.
							<br><br>
							As such, IoT is one of the most important technologies of everyday life and it will continue to pick up steam as more businesses realize the potential of connected devices to keep them competitive.
							<br><br>
							<h3>Benefits of IoT</h3>
							<br>
							The internet of things offers a number of benefits to organizations, enabling them to:
							<br><br>
							<ul>
								<li>Monitor their overall business processes</li><br>
								<li>Improve the customer experience</li><br>
								<li>Save time and money</li><br>
								<li>Enhance employee productivity</li><br>
								<li>Integrate and adapt business models</li><br>
								<li>Make better business decisions, and</li><br>
								<li>Generate more revenue.</li><br>
							</ul>
							<br>
							IoT encourages companies to rethink the ways they approach their businesses, industries and markets and gives them the tools to improve their business strategies.
							<br><br>
							<h3>Pros and cons of IoT</h3>
							<br>
							Some of the advantages of IoT include:
							<br><br>
							<ul>
								<li>Ability to access information from anywhere at any time on any device</li><br>
								<li>Improved communication between connected electronic devices</li><br>
								<li>Transferring data packets over a connected network saves time and money</li><br>
								<li>Automating tasks helps improve the quality of a business’ services and reduces the need for human intervention.</li><br>
							</ul>
							<br><br>
							Some disadvantages of IoT include:
							<br><br>
							<ul>
								<li>As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases</li><br>
								<li>Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers -- maybe even millions -- of IoT devices and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.</li><br>
								<li>If there’s a bug in the system, it’s likely that every connected device will become corrupted</li><br>
								<li>Since there’s no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it’s difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.</li><br>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<h3>The future of IoT</h3>
							<br>
							There is no shortage of IoT market estimations. For example, a few include:
							<br><br>
							<ul>
								<li>Bain & Company expects annual IoT revenue of hardware and software to exceed $450 billion by 2020.</li><br>
								<li>McKinsey & Company estimates IoT will have an $11.1 trillion impact by 2025.</li><br>
								<li>IHS Markit believes the number of connected IoT devices will increase 12% annually to reach 125 billion in 2030.</li><br>
								<li>Gartner assesses that 20.8 billion connected things will be in use by 2020, with total spend on IoT devices and services to reach $3.7 trillion in 2018.</li><br>
							</ul>
