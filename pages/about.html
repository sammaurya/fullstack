					<div class="about">
						<p>Empowered by the rapidly evolving technology, software today are able to solve real-world problems and enable new ways to make human lives better. From ordering a taxi to transferring money with few finger gestures or voice commands, software have led to new realities that were not possible before.
						<br><br>
						We help our customers to disrupt faster by decreasing time-to-market via reducing the time gap between an idea and working software.
						<br><br>
						Our team believes in taking a radically different approach to software development by solving problems at the technology level, rather than mis-utilizing the scarce engineering talent to solve the same problem repeatedly across the solution, so they can focus on delivering more value to the customer.
						<br><br>
						Combining our experience of building 100+ software solutions for our customers following the traditional methodologies and developing our products using decoupled software components to reduce redundant code, we are in a unique position to take the unconventional approach to software development â€“ that led to the birth of TechLeader.
						<br><br>
						Our objective is not to just deliver solutions faster, but to create a snowball effect via faster delivery to help our customers evolve the product according to the needs of the target audience, giving them a much greater advantage over the competition.
